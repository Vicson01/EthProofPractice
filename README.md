## HeroToken Solidity Smart Contract Overview

**Introduction:**  
Presented here is a practical Solidity smart contract named "HeroToken." This contract embodies the basic mechanics for minting and burning tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, with its moniker being "Hero" and the associated symbol as "HRT." Notably, the token's starting supply is zero.

**Quick Start Guide:**

### How to Deploy and Interact:

1. Navigate to the Remix IDE by accessing [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. In the left-hand sidebar, initiate a new file using the "+" icon.

3. Assign your file a .sol extension, like "HeroToken.sol".

4. From this GitHub repository: [HeroToken.sol](https://github.com/Vicson01/EthProofPractice/blob/main/HeroToken.sol), copy the Solidity code. Then, insert it into the file you just created.

5. To compile, head to the "Solidity Compiler" section in the left panel. Choose the "0.8.18" version (or any other suitable version) for the "Compiler" setting. Then, trigger the "Compile HeroToken.sol" action.

6. To set the contract in motion, pick "HeroToken" from the dropdown within the "Deploy & Run Transactions" panel. Then, hit the "Deploy" button.

7. Engage with your contract! You can mint or burn tokens and inquire about various public attributes (like name, symbol, totalSupply, and specific token balances).
   
   - Minting tokens: Under the "HeroToken" section in the left panel, locate and expand the "mint" function. Fill in the desired parameters and then activate the "transact" button.
   
   - Burning tokens: Use the same approach but for the 'burn' function.

   - For balance inquiries of a particular Ethereum address: Insert the address next to the balance function and then execute.
